What would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your wark local?
It enables remote work on the one project for many people.
I can work on my project on many machines in many places.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I have better control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is from one github account to another github account.
Clones is a copy from hithub to local machine or to other localisation on local machine.
Branches are create in one repository e.g. experimental line.
