What would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your wark local?
It enables remote work on the one project for many people.
I can work on my project on many machines in many places.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I have better control.
